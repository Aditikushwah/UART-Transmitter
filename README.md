# UART-Transmitter
**UART communication protocol
In electronics the way with the help of which the devices communicate with
each other is called communication protocol.

There are many protocols which are –

Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)

Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C)

Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART)
It’s one of the simplest methods of communication.

The transmitter converts parallel data to serial data and sends the data.

The receiver receives the serial data and converts it to initial parallel data.
UART transmits data asynchronously.

The advantages of UART are

Only uses two wires

No clock signal is necessary
The structure of the data packet can be changed as long as both sides are set up
for it.
Well-documented and widely used method**
